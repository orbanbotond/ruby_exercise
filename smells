# Ruby Conference

# Piotri Szotkowski
# public by default and mutable by default.
#
# who wrote this crap? -> yey! Sometime in the past YAGNI triumphed.
#
# 1. duplicate method call. Could be costly specially if it is calculation heavy or deals with external services.
#
# "Write code so small so that you can't fit a bug in it! :D"
#
# 2. Data Clump -> Write a composite (value object.)
#  
# 3. Repeated conditional -> predicate method
#
# "Debugging is like being the detective in the same movie where you are the murdered :D"
#
# "How much you feel the need to apologize for things when you introduce the code to a new team member"  
#
# Feature envy:
# ?
# 
# 4 Attribute:
#  
# Setters: Bad
# Getters It depends.
# Refactoring: Tell don't ask
# with (make it immutable):
#  def with(city: @city, name: @name)
#
# How do we find Code Smells:
# "Reek" uses "RuboCop"
#  features: -per directyory configurations.
#
# Code Comments: "War if Peace Freedom is Slavery, Code is Documentation...etc" :D
# 
# Always be critical! Tool: Nice and Jokey small sarcasm...
# Let them know what doesn't work.

# Speculation Mode: Normal but avoid...
# 
# Concise like: remotes.sort.last -> remotes.max
#
# Fájl wrét: File.write :D
#
# 1:
# RUBY =~ /regex/
#
# /regex/.match? (RUBY) (...much faster...!)
#
# /regex/.include?(regex) (...fastest...!)
#
# simple string is the fastest: 'abcdefghijklm'.include? "cde"
# scan???
#
# 2: do not use self
# "#{self.id}-#{name.parameters}"
#
# 3: natural
#   def last_name
#   def first_name ???
#
#  def initialize(protocol, host, port)
#    @port = port
#    @protocol = protocol
#    @host = host ???
#
# 4: triple negation
#  unless !x.blank? ????? 
#
# 5 User.new(name: args[:name], width: args[:width]) -> User.new args.slice(:name, :width)
#
# 6 options = super
#   options[:secure] = true
#   options
#
#   super.tap do |options|
#     options[:secure] = true
#   end
#
# 7 Diff between ^ $ A Z z in regular expr.
